Gargoyle Fury is an epic fantasy game where players must use a slingshot and a limited number of weapons to knock out and eliminate incoming gargoyles. The challenge intensifies as waves of gargoyles attempt to breach the tower wall. If even one gargoyle crosses over, or if the player exhausts their supply of weapons, the level ends.

This game was developed using Unity as part of the Rookie Game Jam Competition for MLabs' Summer Program 2024. Gargoyle Fury is an original game created by the team Bit Builders.
